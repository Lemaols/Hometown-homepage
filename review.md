# Lene Hometown Homepage Review

## Your questions

- I could not figure out why the three different parts,( the hero section, the activity section and the guide section), did not get the right dimensions, it doesn't match what is in the figma guide.

- I could not figure out why the content does not expand/follow if you expand the page itself. I have it set to background-size: cover;. Maybe I have misplaced something?

- In the hero section, I could not figure out how to target the "small containers" of the text of the headers so I could style it. Should they be buttons..?

- I would love to know how to make the text under the three images in the activity section more narrow. How to target it?

- The "card" in the guide section suddenly dropped to the bottom of the page. No matter what I try, it will not place itself in the center ! Why is the card so big, compared to the space it has in the footer?

## My additional feedback

### What you did well
- The design actually looks very close to the Figma specifications! Great job!

- You met the core requirements - have used classes, flexbox and background image, and incorporated the color palette

- Your code is well indented and formatted, easy to read.

- I think you did a good job naming classes and IDs, it's easy to understand what these selectors are for.


### Food for thought

- Can make code DRYer. If you notice you are repeating styles, that may indicate that you can create a class to apply to multiple elements. 

- Unused code - extra divs aren't necessary. You can also use some semantic HTML tags (which you'll learn more later) to help with accessibility and also give your code some landmarks that will make it more readable.

- CSS selectors - tag name, class and ID. A common convention is to use classes for CSS styling rather than IDs. You may learn about something called specificity, and the higher the specificity used will determine what the style is. (Examples in your code.)

- if you are using an external stylesheet (i.e. CSS) try to keep all your styles there. Inline styles actually have higher specificity and can override styles you have in CSS. Might not want that.

- I think it is great that you tried to make this pixel perfect, and you did a great job! Just a reminder that you don't want to copy directly what is in the Figma file, because we actually have other tools we can use to achieve the design with our code. (Examples in your code)

### Overall

- Great job with your first project! Let me know if you have any questions about this feedback. If you make changes, you are welcome to submit it to the team for a code review or you can send me the updated code and I can look it over. :)
